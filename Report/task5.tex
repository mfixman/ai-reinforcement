\section{Individual Reflection}
Me and Martin have worked in tandem to contribute to this project equally. I have provided ideas for most of the algorithms and implemented the DDQN and Target Network methods and the extra task, while Martin has mostly contributed to the environment parameters itself and the implementation of the DQN. However, to say I did this and he did that would be unfair, as we have always sat down and worked together to complete this entire project. All in all, I am satisfied with my and Martin's contributions and I believe he agrees too.
